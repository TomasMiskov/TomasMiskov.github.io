Here I post short chronological updates about my life. Little snippets of what's going on.

- **2024-03-12** Month and a week post surgery. Still residual pain but healing well. Exercising more and more - life will be good! It has to!

- **2024-02-12** Surgery was a success, missing 3rd of my vertebrae but not really missing it - you know what I mean :) Still in a lot of pain but healing is happening. Actually seems like there will be an end to this journey

- **2024-01-12** Met with the surgeon... surgery scheduled for the 1st of Feb. Will this ever end? 

- **2024-01-11** I have some hair back now. Feeling good, anticipating whether will need a surgery or not

- **2023-11-23** Chemo round 14: ✓ IT'S OVER!!!

- **2023-11-15** Today I went mushroom hunting in a local forest. Loved it! Loads of mushrooms, great time. Treatment soon over, more forest on the schedule

- **2023-11-08** RADIO IS OVER!!!

- **2023-11-06** Chemo round 13: ✓

- **2023-11-03** Okay... radiotherapy burned my esophagus so swallowing is super painful. I'm still eating but every meal is a struggle. End is in sight though...

- **2023-10-27** Chemo round 12: ✓

- **2023-10-25** [My 3rd YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iHmulMI6ids) blew up!!! Very happy people like what I made. Fills me up with joy. Motivated to make more

- **2023-10-09** Chemo round 11: ✓

- **2023-10-06** Radiotherapy is claustrophobic but soooo much more managable than chemo

- **2023-10-02** Starting 28 days of proton radiotherapy

- **2023-09-22** Chemo round 10: ✓

- **2023-09-06** Chemo round 9: ✓

- **2023-09-02** Released [my first math-sy YouTube video](https://youtu.be/dpzZBrgTjL0)! Finally making what I was thinking of making for the past year. There are some tiny glimpses of hope on this journey afterall

- **2023-08-14** Chemo round 8: ✓

- **2023-08-14** Spent a weekend with friends, laughed a lot, went to the forest to forage some mushrooms. Cancer sucks but there's some light to be seen in between treatments

- **2023-08-08** Chemo round 7: ✓ It doesn't get easier

- **2023-08-03** Foraged a bunch of wild blackberries and cooked my first ever jam! Just doing the things I always wanted to do but was too busy because of "normal" life

- **2023-07-28** Chemo round 6: ✓ Feels like this will never end

- **2023-07-17** First fresh veggies from my own garden! Super tasty

- **2023-07-12** Chemo round 5: ✓ I'm counting every second... chemo sucks!!!

- **2023-07-08** Went swimming in one of Amsterdam's canals. Really weird feeling in my legs but grateful to be living life

- **2023-06-30** Chemo round 4: ✓ F**k me...

- **2023-06-16** Thought fast would make the chemo side-effects a little milder - not really. Still got properly knocked down, like a really bad flu

- **2023-06-14** Chemo round 3: ✓ Fasted for 69+ hours, felt quite fine

- **2023-06-10** Surprisingly surviving but hair is properly shedding now. Some improvements in my ability to walk - nice!

- **2023-06-03** Chemo round 2: ✓

- **2023-05-30** Got a [port-a-cath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(medical)) inserted today. Should make getting chemo a little more managable in the long run. Can't believe I am saying that. Faith's nuts

- **2023-05-26** Hair started to fall

- **2023-05-17** Got to my garden today. Barely walking and keeping my balance but truly happy to be outside and taking care of soon-to-be vegetable crops. Still processing the reality of being diagnosed with cancer at 23...

- **2023-05-13** Chemo round 1: ✓

- **2023-05-12** We have a diagnosis: [Ewing Sarcoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing_sarcoma). Seems like my foreseeable future is chemotherapy and fight for my life. Enjoy the life you have folks. Just enjoy it!

- **2023-05-04** The tumor is pressing on my spinal cord. I'm loosing proper sensations in my lower body. Coordination and walking is also getting hard

- **2023-04-28** I'm starting this updates page because life is short and I'd like to write down the little (in)significant things that I'd like to look back on and think about. Today, for example, after 2 weeks of terrible back pains, I found out **I have a tumor!!! on my spine...**
