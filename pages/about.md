### Who is Tomáš Miškov?

A Slovak guy (still) living in Amsterdam that can best be described as:

* student
* gym rat
* avid bike commuter
* outdoorsman
* cryophilic (someone who loves cold)
* nerd (for science and technology, not video games)
* minimalist
* entrepreneur/creator

Truthfully though, I am still finding out what I would like to do with my life & career. For now, my interests include statistics, data science, physical fitness, mental endurance/toughness, bicycles as a mode of transport and entrepreneurship. Let's see where all this takes me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### What am I up to these days?

Currently I am studying in a research master's program [Business Data Science](https://businessdatascience.nl/program-outline) at [The Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/about-tinbergen-institute/) in Amsterdam. Alongside my studies, I'm co-managing a tutoring company [Think Smart Tutoring](https://tstutoring.nl/), drawing [sticker designs](https://www.redbubble.com/people/hadicazvysavaca/shop?artistUserName=hadicazvysavaca&asc=u&collections=1790282&iaCode=all-departments&sortOrder=relevant) for fun (and for some side income), and working my ass of in the gym. So pretty much a nerdy-gym-bro-wanna-be-creative-data-scientist at the moment.

### What was I up to in the past?

I graduated from a really cool entrepreneurial high-school called [LEAF Academy](https://www.leafacademy.eu/), that's certainly worth mentioning. In fact, go check it out now! LEAF has some amazing self-improvement programs for people of all ages and backgrounds. They are doing really cool things in Slovakia and the broader CEU region. [Here you go](https://www.leaf.sk/en/).

I then went onto getting my bachelor's education at UvA, where I graduated from [BSc Business Administration](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/bachelors/business-administration/business-administration.html) with specialization in accounting and minor in [Data Science](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/minors/amsterdam-data-science-minor/amsterdam-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence.html). Besides, I've been riding with Deliveroo for a while and I made a bunch of [vlogs](https://youtu.be/mQ4FsImbNKs) from my experience. Gig economy is an interesting concept and I wanted to experience it first hand.

### What can you find on this page?

I intend to use this tiny piece of internet real-estate for my personal thinking, reflections, learning and teaching in a written form. Thus, you should be able to find here essays, journal entries, notes, poems and any other format I find fitting for the occasion. Hope you get a small glimpse into my brain by jumping around here. Thanks for visiting and don't hesitate to reach out if you think we have something in common! Peace ✌︎
