### Rating
**8/10** I would call this genre a highly scientific philosophy with a pinch of fascination with the supernatural. In other words, a stimulating volume of essays on the role of novelty in the success of the human race. I enjoyed the clear structural development of the essays, coupled with intriguing scientific studies, and hints of the supernatural biology that the scientific establishment tends to dismiss. Easy to read, yet makes one thing about who we are.

### Synopsis
A collection of essays on the role of human's fascination with anything and everything <ins>*new*</ins>. Neophilia explores the consequences of (not only) humans' fascination with novelty. Starting all the way at the big bang, the essays explore the itch of the universe to tend to the rare and interesting, and the results of this fact for our biology.
