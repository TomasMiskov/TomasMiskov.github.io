### Rating
**8/10** I might have cried at the end. But there were no witnesses, so, does it even count? Although extremely sad, the story makes you reflect on the relationship with your loved ones and how silly we can be when it comes to love and attraction. Bring tissues if you read this and get ready to ponder the meaning of this all.

### Synopsis
Oscar, a terminally ill boy, has only a few handfuls of days to live. The story takes you through these final days as he finds love in his hospital ward and befriends a nurse who used to be a professional wrestler.  Each chapter is a reflection on his day in a form of a letter to god that treats each 24 hours as a full year of his life.
