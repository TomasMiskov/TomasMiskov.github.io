### Rating
**9/10** Very well written detective story with NOT AT ALL predictable outcome. Plus I got a several lectures worth of teaching in Christian symbolism. Sweet deal if you ask me. Thanks Dan.

### Synopsis
Robert Langdon,  an American professor of ancient symbolism gets tangled in a murder case of the top member of a secret Pagan society. He's not alone though. The church, the police, and another English symbologist are involved in the case as well. Teaming up with Sophie, the granddaughter of the murdered secret society leader, Langdon embarks on the way to solve the murder case and protect the ancient secret guarded by the old Pagan society in the process.

### Notes
- no notes, just thrill!
