### Rating
**8/10** I would have said 10/10 if the last few chapters didn't shatter my dream of the story actually being real. Nevertheless, an interesting take on the interplay of different religions, and then a terrific story of a boy who befriended a tiger... in a tiny boat, in the middle of the sea, being stranded for 200+ days. Quite a journey.

### Synopsis
Pi Patel is the only survivor of a shipwreck... along with Richard Parker, a bengal tiger. They share a small rescue boat while being drifted by the currents of the Atlantic ocean, developing a relationship that in the end saves them both. Or is Richard Parker just a figment of Pi's hopeless imagination? We shall never know.
