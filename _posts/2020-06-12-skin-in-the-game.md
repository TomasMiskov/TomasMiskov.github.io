### Rating
**6/10** I am writing this review quite some time after reading the book, as I am curently reading Taleb's other piece, Antifragile. Although the ideas in both of these books are intriguing, the writing style just isn't my cuppa. Longwinded explanations of his points often including Greek myhtological figures just wear out after a while. That said, I still think the ideas presented can not only benefit our econom, but can be powerful to live by in one's individual life. So have a read, seek people with skin in the game, and build antifragile systems, whether that's your lifestyle, family or the global economy.

### Notes
- I should give this book another shot and make some concrete notes along the way
